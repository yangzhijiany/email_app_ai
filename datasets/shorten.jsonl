Please take time to examine each piece carefully\u2014checking for consistency in style, character accuracy, and alignment with the story\u2019s tone. If you notice any details that should be corrected or adjusted, make notes directly in the packet. I\u2019d like to send consolidated feedback to the illustrator by Friday afternoon. Thanks for lending your keen eye to this review."}
